- Use SOLID principles
- Use .net 8 except Mentor.Uno which required .net 9
- Write tests first, get them to fail, the write production code to make those tests pass
- Always compile the tests, and app target, to check your work.

Keep code tight and constrained to the task at hand.
Do not over-engineer.
If you're uncertain, ask for clarification.
